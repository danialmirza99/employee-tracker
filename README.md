## Description

In this assignment, I worked with MYSQL. I created a database and gave it intial values. From there, I created a javascript file. This file was meant to connect to the database I created through MYSQL. With the javascript file, I can find, add, and manipulate the data I created in the database.

## Installation

Run the command "npm i mysql2" to add SQL to the project. Then run the command "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to include inquirer. Next, run the command "npm i console.table" to add the ability to create rows for the tables. To run the SQL databse, you must travel to the db folder and run the command "mysql -u root -p". There, you are prompted to enter a password. The password is "password123". Finally, you will be inside MYSQL. From here run two commands, "source schema.sql;" and "source seeds.sql". Then, type "exit;". Now travel back to the main folder and run "npm init -y" and "npm install". Finally, you can run "node server.js" to see the results.
